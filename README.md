Coding Bootcamp homework 1 -Jack Fitzhugh

For this homework I had to refactor existing code.

I added several semantic html elements for ease of locating different parts of the webpage, I also added comments describing what every section does within the code body

I added alt attributes to the image elements, and changed the h2 element within the footer section into an h3 element so it wouldnt be larger than other h elements further up the page

I added a more descriptive title to the webpage rather than just "website"

several of the css elements did the same thing and several of the classes and id's on html elements were redundant so I cleaned both up and consolidated the css
